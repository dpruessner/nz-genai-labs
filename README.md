# NZ GenAI Labs

Labs and code snippets shared for the NZ GenAI builder community.

Structure is TBD; contribution guidelines are in the works.

## Tenets 

1. **Accessible**: All code and resources should be open source, use open data, use
   standard frameworks for contributions and transparency.

2. **Useful**: The labs should provide practical, hands-on experience with GenAI
   technologies; projects should be self-contained, low-complexity, and easy to run in
   different environments.

3. **Collaborative**: Encourage contributions from the community, fostering a culture of
   sharing and learning.  Architecture and code is well documented: learning and
   contributing should be easy.

(... unless you know better)


## Organization

Labs are (initially) organized by when they were presented at the NZ GenAI Builder Meetup.
As Labs are added, they will be organized by topic and technology.
